** DONE Make the majority stuff hideable
* TODO create an appropriate 404 page (and sent it also for hack, tag and filename not found -- maybe with some customisation)
* TODO CONSIDER moving the hack data to couchdb too
** TODO maybe add a new /h/{id} path to get hacks data exclusively for newly added hacks, but still allowing the old path scheme for older hacks (hack data need a version identifier)
